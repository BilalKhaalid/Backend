<!-- !  SQL vs NO SQL databases -->

SQL Databases:
Conceptual Overview:

Structure: SQL databases are relational databases that organize data into tables with predefined schemas.
Schema: The schema defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships between tables.
Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query and manipulate the data.
Transactions: ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensure reliability in transactions.
Example:

Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle Database.
Scenario: Suitable for applications with complex queries and transactions, such as banking systems or large-scale enterprise applications.
NoSQL Databases:
Conceptual Overview:

Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats, including document, key-value, column-family, or graph.
Schema: The schema is dynamic, allowing flexibility in the types of data stored.
Query Language: Query languages vary between NoSQL databases, and some use JSON-like documents for queries.
Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability, making them suitable for large-scale distributed systems.
Example:

Database: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
Scenario: Ideal for scenarios with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as content management systems, real-time big data applications, or projects with rapidly changing requirements.
Which One Is Better?
The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your project:

Use SQL Databases When:

Your data has a clear structure.
ACID compliance is crucial for data integrity.
Your application involves complex queries and transactions.
Use NoSQL Databases When:

You have large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Scalability and flexibility are essential.
You're working on projects with evolving requirements.
Ultimately, the "better" choice depends on your project's needs and the characteristics of the data you're dealing with. Many modern applications use a combination of both SQL and NoSQL databases in a polyglot persistence approach to leverage the strengths of each.

<!-- ! which format does mongodb uses? -->

MongoDB uses a binary format called BSON (Binary JSON) to store data. BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. It extends the JSON model to provide additional data types and to be more efficient for storage and traversal.

Key Characteristics of BSON:
Binary Encoding:

BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, making it more efficient for storage and data manipulation.
Data Types:

BSON supports a wider range of data types compared to JSON, including integers, floating-point numbers, dates, binary data, and more.
Richer Structure:

BSON includes additional data types like Date and Binary, which are not natively supported in JSON.
Efficient Storage:

BSON's binary format allows for more compact storage of data, making it efficient for both disk storage and network transmission.

<!-- ! Indexing In MongoDb -->

Concept of Indexing in MongoDB:
Concept:

Indexing in MongoDB is a mechanism to optimize the performance of queries by allowing the database to locate and retrieve documents more efficiently.
An index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of documents based on the values of specific fields.
Without indexes, MongoDB would need to scan every document in a collection to find the desired data, which can be inefficient for large datasets.
Example:

Imagine you have a library of books, and you want to find a specific book by its title.
Without an index, MongoDB would need to go through every book in the library to find the one with the matching title.
With an index on the "title" field, MongoDB can quickly locate the book with the specified title without scanning every document.
MongoDB Indexing Example:
Scenario:
Suppose you have a collection of documents representing books:

<!-- ! json -->

{
"\_id": 1,
"title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
"author": "J.D. Salinger",
"genre": "Fiction"
}
Creating an Index:

<!-- ! javascript -->

// Creating an index on the "title" field
db.books.createIndex({ "title": 1 })
In MongoDB, you can create an index using the createIndex method. The 1 indicates an ascending index on the "title" field.

Querying with Index:

<!-- ! javascript -->

// Querying for a book by title
db.books.find({ "title": "The Catcher in the Rye" })
Explanation:

By creating an index on the "title" field, MongoDB can quickly locate the document with the specified title.
The query is more efficient because MongoDB uses the index to directly find the relevant document instead of scanning the entire collection.
Note:

While indexes improve query performance, they come with a trade-off in terms of increased storage space and additional overhead during write operations.
It's essential to consider the specific queries your application will be running when deciding which fields to index.
In summary, indexing in MongoDB enhances query performance by providing a faster way to access and retrieve documents based on the values of indexed fields.

<!-- ?  Aggregations in Mongo? -->

In MongoDB, the Aggregation Framework provides a powerful and flexible way to perform data transformations and manipulations on the documents in a collection. Aggregations allow you to process and analyze data, applying various operations to obtain meaningful results. Here are the key aspects of MongoDB aggregations:

MongoDB Aggregation in Simple Terms:

MongoDB Aggregation is like using a magic recipe to transform and organize your data. It's a set of steps to group, filter, and calculate things in your collection.

Key Concepts:
Pipeline Stages:

Aggregations are composed of a sequence of stages, known as the aggregation pipeline.
Each stage performs a specific operation on the documents as they pass through the pipeline.
Pipeline Operators:

MongoDB provides a rich set of operators that you can use in each stage of the pipeline.
Common operators include $match, $group, $project, $sort, $unwind, and more.
Expression Language:

The aggregation framework uses an expressive expression language that allows you to manipulate and transform data within the pipeline.
Expressions can include arithmetic operations, logical conditions, and functions.
Example Aggregation Pipeline:
Let's consider a collection of "sales" documents with the following structure:

<!-- ! json -->

{
"\_id": 1,
"product": "A",
"quantity": 10,
"price": 5
}
Example Aggregation Pipeline:

<!-- ! javascript -->

db.sales.aggregate([
// Stage 1: Match documents for a specific product
{ $match: { product: "A" } },

// Stage 2: Group by product and calculate total revenue
{
$group: {
      _id: "$product",
totalRevenue: { $sum: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] } }
}
},

// Stage 3: Project the results to include only relevant fields
{
$project: {
      _id: 0,  // Exclude "_id" field
      product: "$\_id",
totalRevenue: 1
}
}
])
Explanation:

$match:

Filters documents to include only those where the product is "A."
$group:

Groups the matching documents by the "product" field.
Calculates the total revenue using the $sum operator and the $multiply expression.
$project:

Shapes the output of the aggregation.
Excludes the default "\_id" field and renames the "product" field.
Result:

<!-- ! json -->

{ "product": "A", "totalRevenue": 50 }
In this example, the aggregation pipeline filtered, grouped, and projected the data to calculate the total revenue for products with the name "A."

MongoDB aggregations are versatile and can handle a wide range of data processing tasks, making them a powerful tool for analytics and reporting.

<!-- ? Ad-Hoc Query In Mongo? -->

Ad Hoc Query in MongoDB:

Definition:
An ad hoc query in MongoDB is like asking a question on the spot. It's a flexible and dynamic way to query the database without predefined structures.

Example Scenario:
Imagine you have a collection of books:

<!-- ! json -->

{
"\_id": 1,
"title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
"author": "J.D. Salinger",
"genre": "Fiction",
"year": 1951
}
Ad Hoc Query Example:
You want to find books published after 2000 in the "Mystery" genre.

Query:

<!-- ! javascript -->

db.books.find({ genre: "Mystery", year: { $gt: 2000 } })
Explanation:

db.books.find: Start an ad hoc query on the "books" collection.
{ genre: "Mystery", year: { $gt: 2000 } }: Find documents where the genre is "Mystery" and the year is greater than 2000.

In simple terms, ad hoc queries are like asking MongoDB a specific question without having a predefined plan. You can tailor your queries based on what you need at that moment.

<!-- ? what are models and schema in mongo and how to create them? -->

Models and Schema in MongoDB:

Models:

Definition: In MongoDB, a model is like a blueprint for interacting with a specific collection in your database. It provides an interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on documents within that collection.
Purpose: Models help you structure and organize your code when working with MongoDB. They provide methods to interact with the database and enforce certain rules.
Schema:

Definition: A schema defines the structure of the documents within a collection. It specifies the fields each document should have, their types, and any validation rules.
Purpose: Schemas help maintain consistency in your data. They ensure that documents within a collection follow a predefined structure.
How to Create Models and Schemas:

Install Mongoose:

Mongoose is a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js. Install it using npm: npm install mongoose

Create a Schema:

Define the structure of your documents using Mongoose's Schema. For example, if you have a "Book" collection:

<!-- ! javascript -->

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
title: String,
author: String,
genre: String,
year: Number,
});
Create a Model:

Create a model using the schema. This model will provide methods for CRUD operations on the "Book" collection.

<!-- ! javascript -->

const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
Use the Model:

Now, you can use the Book model to interact with the "Book" collection in your MongoDB database.

<!-- ! javascript -->

// Example: Create a new book
const newBook = new Book({
title: 'The Catcher in the Rye',
author: 'J.D. Salinger',
genre: 'Fiction',
year: 1951,
});

// Save the new book to the database
newBook.save()
.then(() => console.log('Book saved'))
.catch((err) => console.error(err));

This is a basic example, but Mongoose provides powerful features like middleware, validation, and more. Using models and schemas with Mongoose helps structure your MongoDB interactions and maintain a consistent data format.

<!--? What is ODM in mongo and which are ODM libraries? -->

ODM in MongoDB:

Definition:
ODM stands for Object Data Modeling. In the context of MongoDB, an ODM is a library that facilitates the interaction between a MongoDB database and your Node.js application by providing a higher-level, object-oriented interface. It allows you to work with data in a more natural, JavaScript-like way, treating database entities as objects.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of an ODM is to bridge the gap between the document-based nature of MongoDB and the object-oriented programming paradigm in languages like JavaScript. ODMs simplify database interactions, provide schema validation, and offer additional features to enhance developer productivity.

Popular ODM Libraries for MongoDB:

Mongoose:

Description: Mongoose is the most widely used ODM library for MongoDB in the Node.js ecosystem.
Key Features:
Provides a schema-based solution for data modeling.
Enforces data validation.
Offers middleware hooks for additional logic.
Supports query building and population for related documents.

npm install mongoose

<!-- ! javascript -->

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
title: String,
author: String,
genre: String,
year: Number,
});
const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);

List of libraries: Mongoose,TypeORM, Waterline

<!-- ? What ORM ? -->

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):

Definition:
ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique that allows data to be accessed, manipulated, and managed in an object-oriented programming language, like JavaScript (with Node.js), without having to interact directly with the relational database's underlying structure.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of ORM is to bridge the gap between the object-oriented world of programming languages and the relational world of databases. It enables developers to interact with databases using programming constructs like classes, objects, and methods, making database operations more intuitive and less reliant on SQL queries.

Key Concepts:

Objects and Classes:

Entities in the database are represented as objects in the programming language, and tables become classes.
Mapping:

ORM maps the structure and relationships of database tables to the corresponding objects and their associations in the programming language.
Abstraction:

Developers interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database schema details.
